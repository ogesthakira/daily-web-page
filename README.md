# daily web page
Made simple script to help me to open Google Chrome and daily web page for work

To make a single executable file, I used pyinstaller. 

1. Run pip install pyinstaller, if you don't have one.
2. Then type "pyinstaller --onefile --noconsle (path/to/py)"
3. Check you executable file on dist folder.
